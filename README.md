## OUTDATED
This patch has been aproved by occulus for inclusion in the oculus store, making this repo redundant. You don't need to patch virtual desktop anymore.
## Virtual Desktop Patch
This is the patch for [Virtual Desktop](https://www.vrdesktop.net/) to allow playing desktop VR games on supported headsets. To use, download the archive and run `install.cmd`, or read it yourself to understand how it works. This script assumes you have adb installed, if you don't you can get it from my [ADB Installer](https://github.com/josephsmendoza/adbi), the Android SDK, or direct download [from google](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools). If you go with direct download, then the files in this repo need to be in the same folder as adb.
### But why?
I'm aware you can get this patch from SideQuest, but I've found that program to be rather invasive so I avoid it as much as I can, see [SideQuest#77](https://github.com/SideQuestVR/SideQuest/issues/77) and [SideQuest#78](https://github.com/SideQuestVR/SideQuest/issues/78).
### But why you?
I asked the Virtual Desktop developer for help but he didn't want to release it elsewehre. He did tell me how it works so I was able to create this repo, but I'm unable to reach him further because an overzealous mod banned me from the discord. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
